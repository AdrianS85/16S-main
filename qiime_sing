# sudo singularity build qiime_sing.img qiime_sing ### this recipe name ###
# sudo singularity shell --bind data:/tmp --cleanenv --writable-tmpfs qiime_sing.img
# cd /tmp

# Working folders need to be structured as such: 
	# Create directory which will be bound with singularity on the /tmp level (call it "Bind", --bind ./Bind:/tmp). This will take care of problem of temporary files being written in singularity-based /tmp folder that would not have access to disk space otherwise.
	# Create directory inside the Bind directory, which will hold entire analysis (call it "Analysis")
	# After these steps, in a single directory we will have .simg container file and Bind/Analysis directory. 
	# The Bind/Analysis directory must contain:
	# 1) data folder containing files to be analyzed (best .cov format, .gz packed) and sample sheet
	# 2) R workflow files
	# Moreover, I think we bind our folder to singularity /tmp, cause nextflow can creata and change folders here??
